# Itsolera Internship Projects

This repository contains the work I completed during my 4-month remote internship as an NLP Intern at Itsolera Pvt Ltd (July 2024 – October 2024).  
The internship focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, with projects ranging from automation to low-resource language translation.

## Projects

### 1. Appointment System
- Implemented a text-based appointment system with intent recognition and automation features.  
- Used NLP techniques to identify scheduling intents and streamline the booking process.  

### 2. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for Low-Resource Languages
- Developed a Roman Urdu → English translation model.  
- Used a T5-based Seq2Seq architecture with attention to handle linguistic complexity.  
- Addressed data scarcity by leveraging Hinglish datasets and applying preprocessing/augmentation.  

### 3. Multilingual Translation with MBART-50
- Built a high-accuracy translation system using Hugging Face’s MBART-50 model.  
- Supports translation across 50 languages and regional dialects.  
- Focused on scalability and contextual accuracy in multilingual NLP systems.
