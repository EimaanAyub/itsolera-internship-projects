# Itsolera Internship Projects

This repository contains the work I completed during my 4-month remote internship as an NLP Intern at Itsolera Pvt Ltd (July 2024 â€“ October 2024).  
The internship focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, with projects ranging from automation to low-resource language translation.
